# Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors

In this project, we will be using `Pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `Jupyter Notebook` to visualize the earnings based on college graduates' majors.

Each row of the data contains a different major and information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.

The data can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)
